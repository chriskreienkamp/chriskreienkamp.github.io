# Machine Learning Steps

## 1. Collect data
* pull from an online repository
* reorganize into x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val
* report how big the training/test sets are
* visualize data so you know what we are dealing with

## 2. Prepare data
* convert to tensors
* resize data
* split into train, test, and validation
* convert to dataloaders

## 3. Train model
* build the model
* create train and test loop functions
* report characteristics of the model
* train

## 4. Evaluate model
* display loss and accuracy curves

## 5. Predict new data
* provide way to save model
* test on new data

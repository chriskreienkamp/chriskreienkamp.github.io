### Work Experience
Sensor Application Engineer | TuSimple (Sept 2021 - Aug 2023)
- Managed the sensors on a fleet of 30+ autonomous semi-trucks with 4 other engineers. Sensors include GNSS+INS, long and short-range LiDAR, radar, ultrasonics, and cameras.
- Designed and developed C++ and Python software to automate sensor and system processes, networking via Ethernet, USB, and serial communication protocols. Version control with Git.
- Uploaded and executed Docker images on the autonomous system. Monitored their performance and collaborated with software engineers to make modifications.
- Owned the sensor phase of the truck upfit process. Includes configuring sensors for their specific use case, analyzing sensor operation and output data, and verifying synchronous communication between sensors, servers, and drive by wire controls in the semi-truck.
- Owned the server phase of the truck upfit process. Includes installing Linux/UNIX operating systems on new servers and modifying network services, access permissions, and firewalls.
- Developed Bash/shell scripts to add speed and robustness.
- Provided real-time troubleshooting support to test engineers during on-road testing. Achieved through SSHâ€™ing into the servers, sifting through system logs, analyzing sensor data, and taking CAN traces to identify the root cause.

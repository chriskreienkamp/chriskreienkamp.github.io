# Welcome
Hello! I am an engineer from the United States, and I currently live in Rome, Italy where I play water polo and study artificial intelligence at Sapienza University of Rome. I use this site to showcase some personal projects that I have been working on. Feel free to reach out!

## Projects

#### [Myst Card Game](https://cjkreienkamp.github.io/myst-webapp/)
Web application card game hosted on GitHub. My friend created the game and wanted to play it against a computer, so I built the application using Qt.

#### [Water Polo Covid-19 Analysis](https://cjkreienkamp.github.io/water-polo-covid-19-analysis)
A study using computer vision to track the proximity of water polo players during a game. This study was then used to predict the potential spread of Covid-19 among athletes.

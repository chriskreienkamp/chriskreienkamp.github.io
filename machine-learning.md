# Machine Learning Steps

## 1. Collect data
* report how big the training/test sets are
* visualize data so you know what we are dealing with
* reorganize into x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val

## 2. Prepare data
* resize data
* split into train, test, and validation

## 3. Train model
* create model
* report characteristics of the model
* train

## 4. Evaluate model
* display loss and accuracy curves

## 5. Predict new data
* provide way to save model
* test on new data

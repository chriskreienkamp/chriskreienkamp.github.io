  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Chris, and I'm an engineer interested in using robots and machine learning to make life safer and a little simpler.
    While studying for my B.S. in mechanical engineering, I got really excited about autonomous vehicles 🚘, so I dedicated significant time to developing my software skillset in Python and C++.
    <br><br>  
    I worked as a sensor engineer at a self-driving truck company for a few years, then I moved to Rome, Italy 🇮🇹 to pursue my dream of playing professional water polo 🤽🏼‍♂️.
    While in Rome I started a Master's degree in artificial intelligence and robotics, and I can't wait to use these skills in my next adventure!
